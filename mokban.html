                <p>Traditional Korean home meals are usually centered around a bowl of rice, a small bowl of soup, and a variety of little side dishes, called 'banchan,' of different textures and flavors, all complementing a main dish as a set. A well-planned Korean meal includes sweet, sour, spicy, bitter and salty tastes that get all your senses going. It may even strive to include all sorts of colors like green, yellow, red, white and black.</p>
                <p>At Mokban, we strive to keep this authenticity of Korean meals, but with a mind towards utilizing more contemporary techniques and presentations for an elevated experience of Korean cuisine.</p>
